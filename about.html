              The success of this humble venture gave us an insight and
              motivation to start a fully equipped residential academy. A new
              set of dedicated men came into the helm of affairs to start the
              residential academy. They were all successful businessmen who
              loved the beautiful game of football.The first goal we set for
              ourselves was to make sure that at least one of our cadets make it
              to the national team for the 2017 under 17 FIFA World Cup to be
              held in India. We set out on a talent hunt to 7 districts in
              Kerala and recruited cadets even from distant states like
              Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. The first chief coach of the
              residential academy was renowned international Jo Paul Ancheri.
          <br/><br/>
              Red Star Academy made its presence felt through hard work and by
              winning some under 17 tournaments. After the initial months Mr.
              Bino George took over as the chief coach. He was a Level A coach
              accredited by the Asian Football Confederation. Through scientific
              and systematic training Red Star could contribute 7 players to the
              under 15 state team in the year 2014. Later that year, 5 of our
              cadets were picked to the probable list of Indian team for 2017
              under 17 world cup. This was after the nationwide trials by the
              German coach Nicolai Adam who was appointed by All India Football
              Federation. From this probable list one player named Jithu K. Roby
              went on to represent India under-17 in the SAFF cup where they
              finished as Runners-up. This indeed was a proud achievement for
              Red Star academy.
          <br/><br/>
              Currently, we have a player named Rishi Dutt in the ongoing Indian
              camp. We have fared creditably in the recently held age group
              tournaments conducted by Kerala Football Association. We have
              appointed Mr.Ranjith T.A. who holds AFC “level A” license as the
              chief coach. He is assisted by Mr.Sudheesh K.R. who is a former
              Calicut University player with AIFF “D level” coaching license. To
              raise the standards and professionalize the club we have decided
              to register a company by name “Red Star FC Thrissur”. We have also
              decided to increase the number of cadets from the current 25 to
              100 covering various age groups. We have also decided to hire the
              services of eminent coaches from India and abroad. We also intend
              to associate with foreign clubs to ensure the best training for
              our cadets.
